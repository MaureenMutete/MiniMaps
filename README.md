# MiniMaps

Mini Maps is a small python project that implements graphs, and calculates the shortest distance between two places.
The project contains two networks: 
- Madaraka Estate Network
- Nairobi Road Network

These Networks are created using Graphs and displayed using matplotlib.

  ### Madaraka Estate Network
  This network uses GreedyBFS Algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between two locations. 

  ### Nairobi Road Network
  This network uses Breadth First Search Algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between two locations.
